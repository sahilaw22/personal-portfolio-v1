## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon blue (#6CFFD9) to give a futuristic and tech-oriented feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A2A2A) for a modern look and to make neon colors pop.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#D48CFF) to complement the blue and enhance the futuristic aesthetic.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. It offers a modern, techy look that aligns well with the app's futuristic theme.
- Use minimalist, glowing icons to maintain the futuristic theme; represent different sections (About, Skills, Projects) with unique icons.
- Implement a grid-based layout for flexible content arrangement. Use clear sections with generous spacing for better readability.
- Subtle animations for content transitions and loading states, enhancing user experience without being intrusive. For example, a smooth fade-in effect.
